python has functional features, oops features and scripting features.

Whesre we can use python:
1. Desktop Applications
2. Web Applications
3. Network Applications
4. Games Development
5. Data Analysis
6. Machine learning 
7. Deep learning
8. Neural Networks, 
9. Artificial Intelligence.
10. Internet of Things.

Features of python:
1. Simple and easy to learn
2. Free ware and open source

Language Fundamentals:
Identifiers:
A Name in python program is called an identifier.
Rules to define identifiers:
1. Identifiers should not start with numbers

5. Identifiers are case sensitive.
x-> variable
_x->protected varaible
__x->private variable
__x__->magic variable.
Reserved words:
import Keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
print(len(keyword.kwlist))

int: to represent numbers in integral values, without decimal values.
1. decimal form-base 10(0 to 9)
2. binary form-base-2(0,1)
3. octal form-base-8,(0 to 7)
4. hexadecimal form-base-16,(0 to 9, A to F),

data types base conversion:
bin()
oct()
hex()
2. float data type:
To represent values in decimal points. 
a=123.23345
